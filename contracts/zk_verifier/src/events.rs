#![allow(deprecated)] // events().publish migration tracked separately
//! # Contract Event Definitions and Publishers
//!
//! This module defines the event schemas emitted by the `ZkVerifierContract`.
//! These events allow off-chain indexers, auditing dashboards, and vision care providers
//! to monitor real-time access requests, admin lifecycle events, and security violations.
//!
//! ## Event Topics & Structure
//! - **Admin Lifecycle**: `ADM_PROP`, `ADM_ACPT`, `ADM_CNCL`
//! - **Access Control**: `REJECT`, `ACC_VIOL`
