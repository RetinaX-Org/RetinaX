# Identity Contract Architectural Deep-Dive

## 1. Overview
The Identity Contract (`contracts/identity`) serves as the core decentralized identity and access registry for the RetinaX system. It manages identity registration, verifiable credential lifecycles, and identity recovery protocols on-chain.

## 2. Core Architecture & Module Breakdown

The identity contract is structured into four primary Rust modules:

| Module | Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lib.rs` | `contracts/identity/src/lib.rs` | Main contract logic, storage definitions, entry points, and access control checks. |
| `credential.rs` | `contracts/identity/src/credential.rs` | Verifiable Credential management, issuance, revocation, and proof verification routines. |
| `recovery.rs` | `contracts/identity/src/recovery.rs` | Multi-sig / social identity recovery mechanisms and key rotation workflows. |
| `events.rs` | `contracts/identity/src/events.rs` | Structured event emissions for indexing identity lifecycle state changes. |

## 3. Data Model & Key Concepts

### Identity Registration & State
- Identity Identifier (DID): Each actor (patient, provider, or system node) is bound to a unique decentralized identifier.
- Attributes & Metadata: Key-value pairs store essential, non-PII identity claims and operational state flags.

### Credential Lifecycle Management (`credential.rs`)
- Issuance: Authorized entities issue cryptographic credentials bound to a target DID.
- Revocation List: On-chain tracking of revoked credential IDs with cryptographic verification support.
- Expiration & Validation: Expiration timestamps and status checks are evaluated on-chain prior to grant execution.

### Identity Recovery Protocol (`recovery.rs`)
- Recovery Guardians: Users define designated recovery guardians or secondary keys.
- Quorum Verification: Key recovery operations require N-of-M threshold signatures before updating an identity's primary controlling address.
- Cooldown & Timelock: Timelocks prevent hostile recovery takeovers by providing a window for the original controller to veto unauthorized recovery attempts.

## 4. Interaction & Data Flow
1. **User / Provider** interacts with main entrypoints in `lib.rs` to manage identities or access resources.
2. `lib.rs` validates permissions and routes requests to `credential.rs` (for issuance/revocation checks) or `recovery.rs` (for guardian quorum & timelock processing).
3. All state transitions emit structured audit events via `events.rs` to be indexed by off-chain indexers.

## 5. Security & Access Control
- Controller Permissions: Direct updates to identity parameters require valid signature authentication from the registered identity controller.
- Guardian Quorum Isolation: Recovery execution is strictly bounded by guardian consensus logic in `recovery.rs`.
- Event Auditing: All credential status transitions emit structured events via `events.rs`.
